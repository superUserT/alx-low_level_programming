0x10-variadic_functions


A Variadic function in C is a function that can take a variable number of arguments. It allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments of different types. The ellipsis (â€¦) is used to represent the variable arguments in the function declaration. The stdarg.h header file is used to access these arguments in the function body. Variadic functions are commonly used in C libraries for functions like printf() and scanf() that take a variable number of arguments.
