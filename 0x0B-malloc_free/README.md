Memory Allocation in C
Memory allocation is a critical concept in the C programming language, as it allows you to manage dynamic memory in your programs. In C, you can allocate and deallocate memory using built-in functions such as malloc, calloc, realloc, and free.

The malloc function is used to allocate a block of memory of a specified size, while calloc allocates a block of memory and initializes its contents to zero. realloc is used to change the size of an existing block of memory, and free is used to deallocate previously allocated memory.

It's important to note that improper use of memory allocation functions can lead to serious issues such as memory leaks, segmentation faults, and other types of undefined behavior. It's crucial to carefully manage memory allocation and deallocation in your programs to ensure optimal performance and stability.

This readme file provides a brief overview of memory allocation in C, including the basic concepts and functions involved. It's recommended to read through this information carefully before attempting to work with dynamic memory in your C programs.
