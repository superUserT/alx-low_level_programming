0x12-singly_linked_lists

A singly linked list in C is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each of which contains a data element and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The first node in the sequence is called the head, and the last node points to a null value to signify the end of the list.

This type of linked list allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at the beginning of the list, but accessing elements in the middle of the list can be slow since each node must be traversed one at a time.

To implement a singly linked list in C, a struct is typically used to define the nodes, with the struct containing both the data element and a pointer to the next node. The head of the list is typically represented as a pointer to the first node in the sequence.

Operations on a singly linked list typically involve traversing the list, either to search for a specific element or to insert or delete a node. Care must be taken to properly handle cases where the list is empty or where the head node needs to be updated.
