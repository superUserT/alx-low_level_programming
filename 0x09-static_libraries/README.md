0x09-static_libraries

This file contains programs and files pertaining to static libraries in c.

Static libraries are collections of object files that are linked directly into an executable at compile time, resulting in a self-contained executable that can be run on any system without the need for the library to be installed. In C programming, static libraries are created using the ar command-line tool, and typically have the file extension .a.

Static libraries are commonly used to provide reusable code across multiple projects, as they allow developers to easily distribute and use their code without worrying about dependencies or version conflicts. To use a static library in a C project, the library file must be included in the build process and the necessary functions must be linked to the executable. This can be done manually or through build automation tools like Makefile or CMake.

Overall, static libraries are a useful tool for simplifying the development and distribution of C code, and can significantly reduce the amount of effort required to manage dependencies and ensure compatibility across different systems.
