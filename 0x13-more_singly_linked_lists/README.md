A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node is called the tail. 

The nodes are connected in a linear fashion, with each node pointing to the next node. This means that we can only traverse the list in one direction, from the head to the tail. 

Here is an example of a singly linked list:

```
head -> [1] -> [2] -> [3] -> [4] -> tail -> null
```

In this example, the head node contains the value `1`, and points to the next node in the list, which contains the value `2`, and so on, until we reach the tail node, which contains the value `4`.

One of the main advantages of a singly linked list is that it allows for efficient insertion and deletion of nodes at the beginning of the list. To insert a new node at the beginning of the list, we simply create a new node with the value we want to insert and point it to the current head of the list. To delete a node from the beginning of the list, we simply update the head to point to the second node in the list.

However, searching for a specific node in a singly linked list can be less efficient, as we have to start at the head and traverse the list until we find the desired node.
